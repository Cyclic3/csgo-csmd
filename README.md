# CS:GO Community Server Materials Downloader

`CSMD` downloads community server's files based on a console log of file requests. It is created for Linux, but can be used on macOS or Windows if needed.

## Rationale

When one chooses a community server in a server list, the client basically executes `connect <ip:port>`, thus establishing communication and requesting any additional files that are missing from the client. For some unknown reason, a reason only Valve employee can know, Linux client refuses to download any content from FastDL type of servers. It has been like that for a very long time and the problem [has been reported](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux/issues/11) to Valve Sep 23, 2014. Since the issue remained unsolved, I decided to create at least some workaround - this script.

## Installation

The script requires Python 3.

Since the script must not be run as root (as it will lock the downloaded files under root), execute this in a terminal exactly as written out as a regular user (i.e. not root)(this assumes `sudo` is configured correctly):

```
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/csgo-csmd https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M-Reimer/csgo-csmd/master/csgo-csmd
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/csgo-csmd
```

Now configure your "Launch Options" for CS:GO to contain -condebug and -conclearlog

> __TIP__: If you want to download less bloat from the community servers, you might want to use `cl_downloadfilter` option in your `autoexec.cfg`. You can set it to "all", "none" or "nosounds" in order to not filter out any files, filter out all files and filter out sound files respectively. Example: `cl_downloadfilter "nosounds"`.

## Usage

1. Find a community server that your client refuses to connect to ("Downloading map <mapname> 0 % / 0 bytes").
2. Open CS:GO console (press `~` A.K.A. tilde, one has to have `-console` in the [game launch options](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=379782151) or `con_enable "1"` in [autoexec.cfg](http://dathost.net/blog/how-to-create-an-autoexec-cfg-for-csgo/)).
3. Type `disconnect` and press `Enter`.
4. Open a terminal (the one with a shell session) and run `csgo-csmd`.
5. Open CS:GO console again and type `retry`.
6. Have fun!

### Command-line arguments

```
usage: csgo-csmd [-h] [--config-path CONFIG_PATH] [--csgo-path CSGO_PATH]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --config-path CONFIG_PATH
                        Path to CSMD config (default:
                        /home/$USER/.config/csmd/csmd.conf)
  --csgo-path CSGO_PATH
                        Path to CS:GO home folder (default:
                        /home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo)
```

## Configuration

CSMD provides a config in INI format (spaces between words are allowed). The default one is created upon the first invocation:

```ini
[path]
csgo_path = /home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo

[log]
use_fifo = false
```

* `csgo_path` can be anything `--csgo-path` accepts (see above)
* `use_fifo` turns on an experimental new feature that makes downloading simpler and faster.

### `use_fifo`
`use_fifo` uses a named pipe to allow csmd to read console output as it occurs.
This means that files, once downloaded, do not have to be checked each time you want to connect to a map.
It also means you do not have to tab out of csgo to load new maps.

Once enabled for the first time (see Configuration above), just start it up before you launch CS:GO. 
After the first launch, it will be able to read the log file even after startup.

To use, simply start csmd, and follow the normal usage steps 1 - 3, 
wait for the console beep (and/or the success message from csmd), and type `retry` in the CS:GO console.

Please be aware that this is *highly* experimental, and therefore may not work as expected.

## Bugs and feature requests

Open new tickets through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/M-Reimer/csgo-csmd/issues). Please take time to describe the problem and copy the logs the script produces.

## Caveats

* CSMD doesn't know how to decompress anything except bzip2
* CSMD doesn't talk HTTPS (only HTTP)

If any of the above makes your life worse, open a new issue.
